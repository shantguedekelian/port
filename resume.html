            <li>Clustered 170K+ Spotify tracks into mood-based groups (e.g., Chill, Hype) using PCA for dimensionality reduction and
K-Means for unsupervised classification.</li>
            <li>Developed an interactive web dashboard with Dash that lets users explore songs by mood, genre, and artist, with dynamic
filtering, hover details, and clickable deep links.</li>
            <li>Integrated Spotify’s API to display real-time album artwork and direct streaming links; enhanced UX with custom CSS for a
clean, modern interface.</li>
            <li>Performed extensive data cleaning and exploratory analysis to ensure audio features were normalized and interpretable for
clustering.</li>

popular post-2016, leveraging EDA, hypothesis testing, and trend analysis.</li>
            <li>Engineered nutritional features from semi-structured lists and performed data cleaning (e.g., handling NMAR/MAR
missingness, mean imputation, normalization via log-transform).</li>
            <li>Built and evaluated multiple regression models to predict protein content (%DV), improving R² from 0.49 (baseline) to 0.84
(cross-validated) using Decision Trees with GridSearchCV.</li>
            <li>Created binary tag-based features (e.g., is_meat, is_high_protein, etc.) by one-hot encoding recipe tags and selecting top
nutritional predictors via correlation analysis. Conducted fairness testing.</li>
